# Queuing_System_Implementation

## How the Concept Developed: 
<p>
With the latest technology trends, people don't like to wait if their web pages don't load within seconds or stay at the restaurant to deliver the food. The project was inspired by customers' waiting time when they call the bank for customer service. In this case, the wait time was 30 mins, which is a lot of time, and it's tough to wait for such a long time. While studying for my Data Analysis and Decision-making course, it was required to develop an end of course project that solved some business problems. So, my team and I developed a system that tries to solve the waiting time.

## How we Executed :
<p>
We used our academic tools like R programming language, probability theory, and the modeling and simulation concepts for the execution of the entire project
Built a model that simulated the customer waiting time of 30 mins at the bank's call center and 15 mins at the doctors' clinic using a single queuing system
Adopted M/M/C queuing model to visualize the changes in the environment, thereby minimizing the wait time
Leveraged R's simmer library that restricts the wait time for customers to 10 mins at the call center and 5 mins at the doctor's clinic
